How Audio Therapy Works

Binaural beats use two slightly different frequencies played in each ear to create a perceived third frequency that can help guide your brain into specific states. Research shows they can improve attention, reduce anxiety, and support cognitive function—making them particularly useful for AD/HD support. Solfeggio frequencies (specific healing tones like 528 Hz for transformation and 432 Hz for natural harmony) can be layered with binaural beats for enhanced effects. Various noise types—white noise for masking distractions, pink noise for better sleep, and brown noise for deep relaxation—can also be combined to create personalized therapy sessions tailored to your needs.

Why Personalization Matters

Everyone has unique needs and sensitivities. MindState gives you complete control to customize every aspect of your audio therapy sessions—from frequencies and volumes to timing and transitions. Create sessions that work specifically for you, not generic presets that may not match your personal response patterns.
