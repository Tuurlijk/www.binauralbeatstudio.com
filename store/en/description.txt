MindState is the only binaural beats app that lets you design completely personalized audio sessions from scratch.

Why Personalization Matters

Every person responds differently to binaural beats. MindState puts you in complete control, allowing you to match frequencies to your personal response patterns for maximum effectiveness.

Powerful Benefits Backed by Science

Scientific studies support remarkable benefits:
• Better Sleep Quality: Delta and theta frequencies help your brain transition into deep, restorative sleep states for improved rest and recovery
• Deep Relaxation & Stress Relief: Lower frequencies help your brain enter deeply relaxed states, reducing anxiety
• Enhanced Focus & Concentration: Higher frequencies help your brain enter optimal states for work, study, and creativity
• Meditation Enhancement: Unlock deeper meditation states and reach theta and alpha states more easily
• Creativity & Flow States: Access your creative potential and enter flow states with alpha frequencies
• Mood Improvement: Elevate your mood and emotional well-being with reduced anxiety and improved quality of life

Complete Control Over Your Audio Experience

Unlike apps with fixed presets, MindState gives you professional-grade tools:

Precise Frequency Control
Set carrier frequencies from 80-600 Hz and beat frequencies from 0.5-40 Hz to match your personal sensitivity. Target brainwave states: Delta (0.5-4 Hz) for deep sleep and relaxation, Theta (4-8 Hz) for meditation and light sleep, Alpha (8-13 Hz) for relaxed focus, Beta (13-30 Hz) for concentration, Gamma (30-100 Hz) for peak performance.

Multi-Layered Session Builder
Layer multiple track types: binaural beats (requires headphones), monaural beats (works on speakers), isochronic tones (no headphones needed), noise generators (white, pink, brown, distant rain, old record, ocean surf), and your own audio files.

Professional Point Editor
Create smooth volume transitions with point-level volume envelopes. Build sessions that start gentle and build intensity, or maintain steady frequencies perfect for sleep and relaxation.

Granular Session Control
Preview playback before saving. Adjust frequencies, volumes, timing, and transitions with precision. Create sessions for sleep, meditation, focus, stress relief, or experimentation.
