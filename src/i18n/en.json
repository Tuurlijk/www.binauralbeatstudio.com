    "howItWorks": {
      "title": "How Brainwave Entrainment Works",
      "subtitle": "The science behind the transformation",
      "explanation": "When you listen to two slightly different frequencies (one in each ear), your brain naturally perceives a third frequency—the difference between them. This is called a binaural beat. Your brain then synchronizes its own electrical activity to match this perceived frequency, a phenomenon known as brainwave entrainment.",
      "noHeadphones": "MindState also supports monaural beats and isochronic tones, which work without headphones. Monaural beats are created by mixing two frequencies before they reach your ears, while isochronic tones use evenly spaced pulses of a single tone. Both can effectively entrain your brainwaves when played through speakers, making it easy to enjoy the benefits during meditation, work, or sleep—no headphones required.",
      "personalization": "Different frequencies unlock different mental states: Delta (0.5-4 Hz) for deep sleep, Theta (4-8 Hz) for meditation and creativity, Alpha (8-13 Hz) for relaxed focus, Beta (13-30 Hz) for active concentration, and Gamma (30-100 Hz) for peak performance. By personalizing carrier frequencies and beat frequencies to match your unique sensitivity, you can maximize the benefits and achieve your desired mental state more effectively."

    "safety": {
      "title": "Safe & Well-Studied",
      "subtitle": "Binaural beats are generally safe for most people when used responsibly",
      "general": "Binaural beats have been studied for decades and are considered safe for the majority of users. They work through natural brainwave entrainment and don't require any invasive procedures or substances.",
      "precautions": "If you have epilepsy or a history of seizures, consult with a healthcare provider before use. Keep volume at comfortable levels—excessive volume can cause hearing damage. If you experience any discomfort, discontinue use. Binaural beats are not a replacement for medical treatment or professional mental health care."

While individual results may vary, the scientific evidence continues to grow, supporting the use of binaural beats as a tool for mental enhancement and well-being.",
