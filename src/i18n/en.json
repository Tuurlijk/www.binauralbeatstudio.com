    "howItWorks": {
      "title": "How Brainwave Entrainment Works",
      "subtitle": "The science behind the transformation",
      "explanation": "Brainwave entrainment is how rhythmic sound can influence your brain's electrical activity. One method is binaural beats: when you listen to two slightly different frequencies—one in each ear—your brain perceives a third frequency, the difference between them, and may synchronize to it. Isochronic tones (evenly spaced pulses of a single tone) and monaural beats (two frequencies mixed before they reach your ears) work similarly and can entrain brainwaves through speakers—no headphones required. Beyond beats and tones, noise types such as white, pink, and brown noise can support focus and relaxation by masking distractions and helping to optimize arousal levels, making them a valuable part of audio therapy.",
      "noHeadphones": "Monaural beats and isochronic tones effectively entrain brainwaves when played through speakers, so you can enjoy the benefits during meditation, work, or sleep without headphones.",
      "personalization": "Different beat frequencies are linked to different mental states: Delta (0.5-4 Hz) for deep sleep, Theta (4-8 Hz) for meditation and creativity, Alpha (8-13 Hz) for relaxed focus, Beta (13-30 Hz) for active concentration, and Gamma (30-100 Hz) for peak performance. By combining beats, tones, and noise and matching them to your sensitivity and goals, you can tailor sessions for maximum benefit."

    "adhdNoise": {
      "title": "White & Pink Noise for AD/HD Focus",
      "subtitle": "Research shows noise can help improve attention and reduce impulsivity in people with AD/HD",
      "description": "A meta-analysis of 13 studies with 335 participants found that white and pink noise led to small but statistically significant improvements in task performance for children and young adults with AD/HD. Benefits included less impulsivity, better attention, and fewer errors. Interestingly, these noise types helped people with AD/HD but not those without, suggesting they work by optimizing brain arousal levels specifically for AD/HD brains."

      "title": "Binaural Beats for AD/HD Symptoms",
      "subtitle": "Pilot studies show promise for attention and homework-related improvements",
      "description": "A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study with 20 children and adolescents with AD/HD found that listening to binaural beats (20 minutes, 3 times per week for 3 weeks) led to significant improvements reported by parents. While objective attention tests didn't show significant changes, parents reported fewer homework problems related to inattention, suggesting real-world benefits for daily functioning."
    },
    "safety": {
      "title": "Safe & Well-Studied",
      "subtitle": "Binaural beats are generally safe for most people when used responsibly",
      "general": "Binaural beats have been studied for decades and are considered safe for the majority of users. They work through natural brainwave entrainment and don't require any invasive procedures or substances.",
      "precautions": "If you have epilepsy or a history of seizures, consult with a healthcare provider before use. Keep volume at comfortable levels—excessive volume can cause hearing damage. If you experience any discomfort, discontinue use. Binaural beats are not a replacement for medical treatment or professional mental health care."

Studies have found positive effects on relaxation, stress reduction, and cognitive performance. While individual results may vary, the scientific evidence continues to grow, supporting the use of binaural beats as a tool for mental enhancement and well-being.",
